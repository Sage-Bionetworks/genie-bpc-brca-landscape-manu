Todo:

- Change all files to load in the data in data/cohort_clin_data
- Create a makefile to automate the running of this code.
- Consider looking at cpt_order_int for survival.  I think it's too incomplete to use.
- Switch brca_regimens.rmd and process_drug_data.R away from using data lists,
   and use the individual datasets instead.
- Look at whether we have the time of test ordering for any patients.
